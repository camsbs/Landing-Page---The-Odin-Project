The Bandeira family's passion for coffee began with Wilson Bandeira, who learned the craft from his father and grandfather in Rio de Janeiro. He honed his skills over the years, experimenting with different roasting techniques and blending methods until he achieved the perfect cup of coffee. Wilson's dedication to his craft paid off, and his coffee quickly became a favourite among locals and visitors alike.

In the early 2000s, the Bandeira family decided to expand their business and bring their coffee to a new market: Dublin, Ireland. They opened a coffee shop in the heart of the city, where they continued to roast their coffee beans to perfection and serve them up to customers with a smile. The response was overwhelmingly positive, and the Bandeira family soon became known for their rich, flavourful coffee and warm hospitality.

Despite their success, the Bandeira family never lost sight of their roots. They continued to use only the finest Arabica beans from Brazil, which they sourced directly from local farmers. They also invested in the latest brewing technology, including state-of-the-art espresso machines and pour-over equipment, to ensure that every cup of coffee was of the highest quality.

Word of their exceptional coffee spread, and the Bandeira family soon found themselves exporting their coffee to countries around the world. Their commitment to quality and their passion for coffee have helped them establish themselves as a leading brand in the industry, with a loyal following of customers who appreciate the care and attention that goes into every cup.

Today, the Bandeira family's legacy lives on, with Wilson's children and grandchildren continuing the tradition of roasting and blending coffee beans to perfection. They remain committed to using only the finest ingredients, and their dedication to their craft is evident in every cup of coffee they serve. Whether you're in Dublin, Rio de Janeiro, or anywhere else in the world, you can taste the Bandeira family's passion for coffee in every sip.
